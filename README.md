# How to Clone

## Prerequisites
Before cloning the repository, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js (LTS version recommended)](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or npm (comes with Node.js)

## Step 1: Clone the Repository
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/directory
   ```
3. Run the following command to clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-nextjs-project.git
   ```
   Replace `your-username` and `your-nextjs-project` with the actual repository details.

## Step 2: Navigate into the Project Directory
```bash
cd your-nextjs-project
```

## Step 3: Install Dependencies
Using npm:
```bash
npm install
```
Using Yarn:
```bash
yarn install
```
Using pnpm:
```bash
pnpm install
```

## Step 4: Start the Development Server
Run the following command to start the Next.js development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Or, if using Yarn:
```bash
yarn dev
```
Or, if using pnpm:
```bash
pnpm dev
```
The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
